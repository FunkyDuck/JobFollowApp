# JobFollow (jobfollow-app)

## Description
JobFollow is an app to track your job applications.
This is version 2 â€” a previous version was written with Flutter.
After a few years away from Flutter, I preferred to rewrite it using JavaScript and Vue.
This version uses Vue 3, Quasar Framework, and PouchDB for offline-first capabilities.
It helps you stay organized, monitor your application progress, and never miss a follow-up.
